# Special Topics: Bioastronautics
Course Website for Special Topics in Bioastronautics (Spring 2025) at [UATX](https://www.uaustin.org/).

Special topics in bioastronautics is a project-based course that immerses students in real-world challenges in bioastronautics. This term, students will contribute to research initiatives stemming from [UATXâ€™s partnership with the Space Exploration and Research Agency (SERA)](https://www.sera.space/pressrelease/articles/cornell). Through hands-on experience, they will design and prototype spaceflight-ready plasticware for molecular biology experiments using 3D printing and submit their designs in the SERA Fluid Dynamics Competition. Additionally, students will explore the fundamentals of cell culture in spaceflight environments, gaining critical skills for conducting biological research beyond Earth.

## Course Grading
- 50% SERA Fluid Dynamics Competition Proposal
- 50% Readings, Reflections, Quizzes, Essays
